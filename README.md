### Hi, I'm Hunter Dyar.

I am a creative technologist, photographer, developer, and educator. I work with digital capture technologies and novel digital media processes to create and develop interesting workflows, and I produce open academic resources.

I am an Assistant Professor of Immersive Media at Chatham University.
